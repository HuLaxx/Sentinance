### SENTINANCE / THE SIGNAL ATLAS

**A market-intelligence engineering project exploring how raw exchange data becomes structured signals, model outputs and AI-assisted analysis.**

## 01 / The problem: markets generate noise

Exchange feeds arrive continuously. Indicators and forecasts create more signals, while analysts still need a way to interpret them and understand **which parts of a conclusion are measured, modeled or generated**.

Sentinance explores one connected engineering answer: normalize market information, expose it through consistent APIs, add analytical and AI-assisted paths, then present it through a fast, readable dashboard.

> **Design principle:** Separate the observed market data from the system's predictions and AI-generated interpretations.

## 02 / The system map

<sub>Architectural overview: some external services are optional, configured or run with mock fallbacks. See the integration inventory below.</sub>

### Four stages, one story

| Stage | Responsibility | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01. Capture** | Work with market connectors and external feeds | [Multi-exchange aggregation](apps/api/multi_exchange.py) |
| **02. Analyze** | Calculate technical indicators and investigate forecasting approaches | [Indicators](apps/api/indicators.py) · [Prediction API](apps/api/predictor.py) |
| **03. Reason** | Explore LangGraph orchestration, LLM fallbacks and retrieval | [Agent](apps/api/agent.py) · [RAG service](apps/api/rag_service.py) |
| **04. Explain** | Surface insights in dashboard and asset interfaces | [Next.js frontend](apps/web/src/app) · [API routes](apps/api/main.py) |

## 04 / Capability truth table

This repository includes real implementation code **and** infrastructure that is optional, local-first, configured or simulated. These should not be confused with a fully running hosted stack.

| Capability | Repository-level status | Where to verify |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Next.js web experience / FastAPI endpoints | Implemented in source | [Web](apps/web) · [API](apps/api) |
| Price WebSocket and technical indicator paths | Implemented in source; availability depends on data providers | [API modules](apps/api) |
| Gemini / Groq model responses | Provider-dependent; mocked fallback documented | [Stack inventory](docs/TECH_STACK.md) |
| LangGraph research orchestration | Agent code exists; mock-agent paths documented | [Agent](apps/api/agent.py) |
| LSTM prediction / PyTorch | Optional model; mock predictions documented | [Forecasting](apps/api/predictor.py) |
| PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Kafka, MLflow and Kubernetes | Mix of local/configured integrations, not proof of hosted operation | [Integration status](docs/TECH_STACK.md) · [Infrastructure](infra) |
| Tests / code coverage | Suites exist; **current pass count and coverage not independently verified here** | [API tests](apps/api/tests) · [Web tests](apps/web/src/__tests__) |

**Testing note:** Historical README figures are not live badges. Run the suites below or review the latest CI results before citing accuracy, latency, pass counts or coverage.

## 05 / Technology layers

| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| Frontend | Next.js 16, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| APIs and streaming | Python, FastAPI, WebSocket, SSE |
| Analytics and ML | NumPy, PyTorch, LSTM forecasting, technical indicators |
| AI / retrieval | LangGraph, Gemini/Groq integrations, Qdrant (optional/fallback) |
| Data services | PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, dbt (availability varies by environment) |
| Platform | Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes and monitoring configurations |

For precise package versions and whether a dependency is live, simulated or merely configured, use the [technical integration inventory](docs/TECH_STACK.md).

## 06 / Run the system locally

**Prerequisites:** Git, Node.js compatible with the current Next.js version, Python 3.10+ and optionally Docker. Refer to [setup documentation](docs/SETUP.md) and the repository's example environment files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuLaxx/Sentinance.git
cd Sentinance
cp .env.example .env

# Optional: start local infrastructure
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# API (separate terminal)
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Web (another terminal, from repo root)
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

On Windows, activate the Python virtual environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate`. Configure environment variables locally and **never commit real secrets**. External integrations may require credentials, a trained model and running infrastructure.

Useful local endpoints (when corresponding services are running): [Web](http://localhost:3000) · [FastAPI docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) · [API health](http://localhost:8000/health).

### Testing

```bash
# From repository root
cd apps/api
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# In a separate shell
cd apps/web
npm run test -- --run
```

Tests have not been executed as part of this presentation-only README update. Do not treat the commands as a verified green build.

## 07 / Engineering decisions

Great technical work is easier to trust when it shows **why** trade-offs were made.
